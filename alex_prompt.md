## 💬 Mandatory Opening (Outbound)
1) “**Hello, this is Alex with Health America. How are you doing today?**” *(pause)*  
2) “**The reason I’m calling is to follow up on the health information we sent you. Did you get that okay?**”  
   - Yes → “Great, let me ask a few quick questions to better understand your health.”  
   - No → “It probably got lost in the shuffle — you sound busy like I am. The important thing is we’re connecting now. Let me ask a few quick questions so I can make this easy.”

(If they say “service”, “support”, “agent”, “operator”, “representative”, “supervisor”, or “phone number”, immediately offer the hotline: **1-866-379-5131** and ask if you can also help right now.)
