# Sales Presentation — v1.1.0

> **Scope:** External‑facing narrative that preserves **Core Rules, Introduction, and Qualifying Timeline** verbatim, while expanding content with visuals, use cases, and testimonials.

## Core Rules (Unaltered)
- **Value Window:** 6–10 minutes of value building before any pricing. Minimum 4 qualifying questions, up to 10.
- **Sequence:** 6‑Month Program → 3‑Month → Monthly Membership ($79 → $59). No single‑bottle starts.
- **No Money‑Back Guarantee:** Only product purity/quality statements allowed.
- **No “pause” Verbalization:** Silent waits only.
- **Discount Unlocks:** 15% or gift only if senior, veteran, or after two separate price objections.
- **Standard Close:** “Your order will arrive in five to seven days. Thank you for choosing Health America. If you ever need anything, our number is 1‑866‑379‑5131.”

## Introduction (Unaltered)
“Hello, can you hear me okay?” *(~900ms silent wait)*  
“Great! The reason for the call today is to follow up on the health information we sent out to you. Did you get that okay?”

- If **Yes:** “Perfect. I'm so glad I have you on the phone today and have the chance to follow up. May I ask you a few quick questions about your health?”
- If **No:** “That’s fine, it probably got lost in the shuffle. You sound busy, I get it. The important thing is, we’re connecting now. May I ask you a couple of quick questions about your health today?”

## Qualifying Timeline (Unaltered)
- 3–4 minutes within the 6–10 minute value window
- Ask 4–10 questions; confirm **all** health issues before recommending
- Slow rhythm on questions; increased energy when presenting benefits

## Presenter Notes
- Mirror the caller’s phrasing; repeat their goals before each benefit statement.
- Keep the tempo human: curious during discovery, passionate when presenting, composed on the close.
- Never drift into forbidden language. If “guarantee” is requested, state only purity/quality assurances.
