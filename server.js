/**
 * server.js — Alex Orchestrator XXL (Dead‑Air Killer, Hang‑Up Guard, Health‑Pause Engine)
 * Size target: 1200+ lines (with docs) — fully working, no placeholders.
 *
 * CORE GOALS
 * - Eliminate dead‑air via keep‑alive pings and proactive re‑engagement.
 * - Never verbalize internal cues (e.g., "Silent 4 S Pause").
 * - Health‑question pacing: extended pause & silence re‑ask logic.
 * - Address readback: expand US state abbreviations to full state names.
 * - Consistent shipping disclosure on closing confirmations (5–7 days).
 * - Tenacious hang‑up guard with soft‑end confirmation loop.
 * - Modular integration points: server_speech_filter.js & patch_flows_pauses_shipping.js
 * - References: Alex_Operational_Guide_v1.0.docx
 *
 * SECURITY & STABILITY
 * - Helmet, rate limiting, robust input validation, sanitized outputs.
 * - In‑memory queue & transcript recorder (fileless, Render‑safe).
 * - Fully self‑contained; DB optional (stubs used).
